## How to install? Prerequisities

You MUST have : `node & npm`

After successfully installing node run the following command:

```
npm install yarn -g
```
This will install yarn globally. This project was built with yarn as package manager in mind. 

I have not tested with npm as pkm. Raise an issue if you see a problem with npm.

## Husky & Commitizen initialization

Next head over to the root folder of your project and type
```
yarn install && yarn husky-init && yarn run start
```

This will configure husky & commitizen to automatically prettify and lint your files. 

As well as commit by the conventional commit [standard.](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Best commit practices for me are:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit
```
After `$ git commit` the terminal will call husky pre-commit hook which will lint all files. 
Then husky will call the prepare-commit-msg which on its side will prompt the commitizen conventional commit interface.

Lastly, of course, after selecting the type of commit and commit message we need to push our changes.
```
$ git push
```

## Backend section ðŸ‘‡
The backend is a AWS Lambda fuction containing Serverless Express Backend and exposing a AWS APIGateway REST API ðŸ‘‰ [link](https://bvj938q4m0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev)

Current routes configured: [device, user]. Each endpoint except login and register is protected with JWT token.

### /device 
#### PATCH
Endpoint for updating a device. Example request path: `/device?id=1234`
Updates a device with deviceId provided in queryParams and device properties to update in body. 
UserId is extracted from the JWT token and checked if it matches the userId of the device to be updated.

Passing following device object body
```
{
    "id": "1234", // id is provided by the user and has to be unique. Optional.
    "name": "Device updated.", // name is provided by the user. Optional.
}
```
And the output if successful is the updated device object with all properties that also includes id and userId:
```
{
    "id": "1234",
    "name": "Device updated",
    "userId": "1234",
}
```

```
{
    "id": "1234",
    "deviceId": "1234",
    "timestamp": "153234234", // Unix timestamp
