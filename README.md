# Changelog
See the [changelog](https://github.com/Automating-Hydroponics-BPR2/via-sem7-bpr2-client/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to see latest changes.

Raise an [issue](https://github.com/Automating-Hydroponics-BPR2/via-sem7-bpr2-client/issues) if you see something that needs improvement or witness a bug with the template

## How to install? Prerequisities

You MUST have : `node & npm`

After successfully installing node run the following command:

```
npm install yarn -g
```
This will install yarn globally. This project was built with yarn as package manager in mind. 

I have not tested with npm as pkm. Raise an issue if you see a problem with npm.

## How to install? Dependencies

After installing yarn, head over to the root folder of your project and type
```
yarn install
```
This will install all dependencies for the project.

## How to install? Husky & Commitizen initialization

Next head over to the root folder of your project and type
```
yarn husky:init
```

This will configure husky & commitizen to automatically prettify and lint your files. 

As well as commit by the conventional commit [standard.](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

## Best commit practices for me are:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit
```
After `$ git commit` the terminal will call husky pre-commit hook which will lint all files. 
Then husky will call the prepare-commit-msg which on its side will prompt the commitizen conventional commit interface.

Lastly, of course, after selecting the type of commit and commit message we need to push our changes.
```
$ git push
```

However, if you want you can use the already defined script for commiting changes:
```
$ yarn run push
```

This will run all of the above commands in one go.

## Backend section ðŸ‘‡
The backend is a AWS Lambda fuction containing Serverless Express Backend.

### JWT Token
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. [Learn more](https://jwt.io/)
The token is generated on the backend and returned to the frontend after a successful login or register. The token is then stored in the local storage of the browser and is used for authentication on the backend. The token has an expiration time of 1hr.

[![JWT Token](https://jwt.io/img/pic_logo.svg)](https://jwt.io/)

### Jest
Jest is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. [Learn more](https://jestjs.io/)
Jest is used for testing the backend. The tests are located in the `__tests__` folder. The tests are run on every push to the main branch using Github Actions.

[![Jest](https://jestjs.io/img/jest.png)](https://jestjs.io/)

### BCrypt
BCrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David MaziÃ¨res, based on the Blowfish cipher. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
BCrypt is used for hashing the password of the user on the backend. The password is hashed before storing it in the database. The password is decrypted when the user logs in and is compared with the password in the database.

## API Endpoint Documentation\
The API has been developed in AWS APIGateway and is exposed in 2 stages: Main and Dev.

```
ðŸ‘‰ Main [link](https://1aelqys6w7.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/main)
ðŸ‘‰ DEV [link](https://bvj938q4m0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev)
```

Current routes configured: [device, user]. Each endpoint except login and register is protected with a JWT token. The token is extracted from the Authorization header and is checked if it is valid and not expired. If the token is valid the request is processed, otherwise the request is rejected with 401 **Unauthorized** status code.

### /device
#### PATCH
Endpoint for updating a device. Example request path: `/device?id=1234`
Updates a device with id provided in queryParams and device properties to update in body. 
UserId is extracted from the JWT token and checked if it matches the userId of the device to be updated.

Passing following device object body
```
{
    "deviceId": "1234-1234-1234", // String. deviceId is provided by the user and has to be unique. Optional. Must be between 10 and 20 characters if not unchanged
    "name": "Device updated âœ…", // String. Name is provided by the user, "Unnamed Device" otherwise. Optional. Must be between 10 and 20 characters if not unchanged
}
```
And the output if successful is the updated device object with all properties (updated and not updated) that also includes id and userId:
```
{
    "id": "443155a5-5494-4269-84df-fe848b0f2bb0", // String. The id of the device is also returned with the response
    "deviceId": "1234-1234-1234", // String. The deviceId if specified, otherwise the old deviceId is returned
    "name": "Device updated âœ…", // String. The name if specified, "Unnamed Device" otherwise.
    "userId": "1234", // String. userId of the user that updated the device is also returned with the response
